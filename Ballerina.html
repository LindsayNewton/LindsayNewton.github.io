<li>Tutu</li>
  <p> A tutu is a piece of clothing worn by female ballet dancers. The Classic tutu is short and stiff and protrudes out from the hip, and the Romantic tutu is longer, softer and fall in a bell-like fashion. Tutus are usually attached to the bodice of the dress. They can be made from a number of different materials such as tulle, muslin or silk. The modern tutu comes in several different styles such as the Pancake tutu, the Platter tutu and the American tutu.</p>

<li>Ballet Slippers</li>
  <p> Ballet slippers are also known as pointe shoes. They are covered in satin and come mainly in different shades of pink. The toe is traditionally made from layers of cardboard and glue that are shaped into a "box" which is how the dancer is able to balance ontheir toes. The sole is made from leather and gives the dancer traction on smooth sufaces, such as stages, but also acts as a support for the arch of the foot.</p>
