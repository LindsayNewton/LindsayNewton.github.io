<li>Ballerina</li>
  <p> Ballerinas, or ballet dancers, use their bodies to tell a story through dance. Accompanied by an orchestra, they use the music to help them connect with their audience.</p>

<li>Tutu</li>
  <p> A tutu is a piece of clothing worn by female ballet dancers. It is either short and stiff and protrudes out from the hip, or can be longer and softer and fall in a bell-like fashion. Tutus are usually attached to the bodice of the dress. They can be made from a number of different materials such as tulle, muslin or silk.</p>

<li>Dance</li>
  <p> Professional dancers train fom as early an age as 5 to become ballerinas. There are many dance companies around the world. The most prestigious among them are the Bolshoi Ballet from Russia, The American Ballet Theatre from the United States and the Paris Opera Ballet from France.</p>
<li>Ballet Slippers</li>
  <p> Ballet slippers are also known as pointe shoes. They are covered in satin and come mainly in different shades of pink. The toe is traditionally made from layers of cardboard and glue that are shaped into a "box" which is how the dancer is able to balance ontheir toes. The sole is made from leather and gives the dancer traction on smooth sufaces, such as stages, but also acts as a support for the arch of the foot.</p>
