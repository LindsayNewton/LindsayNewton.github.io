<li>Tutu</li>
  <p> A tutu is a piece of clothing worn by female ballet dancers. It is either short and stiff and protrudes out from the hip, or can be longer and softer and fall in a bell-like fashion. Tutus are usually attached to the bodice of the dress. They can be made from a number of different materials such as tulle, muslin or silk.</p>
