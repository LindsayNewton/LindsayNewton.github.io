    <p><i> Ballerina-Land is inspired by two little girls who make the idea of becoming a dancer a beautiful dream. The way their faces light up when they talk about dancing, or how a tutu is considered a must-have clothing item for everyday wear, gives those of us who once dreamed of being a ballerina a nostalgic and hopeful feeling.</i></p>
