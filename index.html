    <h1> History of Ballet</h1>
    <p class="cool"> Ballet originates from Italy in the 1500's. This was during the Renaissance Period when Europe had emerged from<br> the Middle Ages and started to explore new ways of thinking, new ideas in architecture and politics and was,overall, a great<br> time of social change. Historians say that the birthplace of the Renaissance came from the Italian city of Florence and the patriarchal<br> family of Florence, the Medici's, is credited with this emergence of change. Their dynasty lasted several hundred years and they were<br> patrons of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Galileo and more. They funded St. Peter's Basilica, Santa Maria del Fiore and<br> financed the invention of opera and the piano. When Catherine de Medici married King Henry II of France she brought with her her love of<br> the arts. When festivals were being held she made the directors feature more dance numbers (for they were her favorite) and this lead to<br> a new art form called <i>ballet de cour</i>. The first authentic ballet was titled <i> Ballet Comique de la Reine</i> and debuted in 1581.<br> In 1827 Romantic Ballet was born with La Sylphide. It was performed by Marie Taglioni and was choreographed by her father to feature her. <br> La Sylphide was inspired by Romanticism and also introduced pointework into the ballet dancers repertoire. Since its inception, ballet has evolved into<br> what we know, and love, it to be.</p>
