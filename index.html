    <p> Ballet originates from Italy in the 1500's. This was during the Renaissance Period when Europe had<br>
      emerged from the Middle Ages and started to explore new ways of thinking, new ideas in architecture<br>
      and politics and overall great social change. Historians say that the birthplace of the Renaissance came<br>
      from the Italian city of Florence and the patriarchal family of Florence is credited with this emergence<br>
      of change. This family, the Medici's, were a dynasty that lasted several hundred years and were patrons of<br>
      Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Galileo and more. They funded St. Peter's Basilica, Santa Maria<br>
      del Fiore and financed the invention of opera and the piano. Catherine de Medici married King Henry II of<br>
      France and brought with her her love of the arts. When festivals were being held she made the directors<br>
      feature more dance numbers for the climaxes of the shows and this lead to a new art form called<br>
      <i>ballet de cour</i>. The first authentic ballet was titled<i> Ballet Comique de la Reine</i> and debuted <br>
      in 1581. Since its inception, ballet has evolved into what we know it to be. In 1827 Romantic Ballet was<br>
      born with La Sylphide, performed by Marie Taglioni. It was inspired by Romanticism and also introduced<br>
      pointework into the ballet dancers repertoire.</p>
